=> Parallelization

GOAL:
	- Being able to run builds in parallell
	- After build refactoring is done, investigate this.

=> Delayed loads


GOAL:
	
	- Being able to output 1Gb of data from a pipeline and then do an incremental build that changes some
	  unrelated data, and not having to read the 1Gb data from disk just to go through packaging step.


TO ACHIEVE:
	- Need to be able to add pending loads into the database
	- Need to be able to read meta-data from previous/cached builds
		- To walk dependencies (for packaging)
		- Check if exists (for building/etc)

	- Replace packaging walk_dependencies with reads from meta-data,
	  possibly from build-db.
